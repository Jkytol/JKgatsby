using UnityEngine;

public class playerMovement : MonoBehaviour
{

    public float moveSpeed = 5f;
    public Rigidbody2D rb;
    public Animator animator;
    Vector2 movement;



    // Update is called once per frame
    void Update()
    {
        movement.x = Input.GetAxisRaw("Horizontal");
        movement.y = Input.GetAxisRaw("Vertical");

        animator.SetFloat("Horizontal", movement.x);
        animator.SetFloat("Vertical", movement.y);
        animator.SetFloat("Speed", movement.sqrMagnitude);
    }

void FixedUpdate(){
        rb.MovePosition(rb.position + movement * moveSpeed * Time.fixedDeltaTime);
    }

}
